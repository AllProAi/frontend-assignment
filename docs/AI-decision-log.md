# AI Architecture Decision Log

## 2023-04-04: Initial Project Setup

### Decision 1: Technology Stack Selection
- **Context**: Need to select a modern, efficient technology stack for Tetris game implementation within 4-hour constraint.
- **Decision**: Selected React + TypeScript + Vite + Styled Components stack.
- **Rationale**:
  - React provides component-based architecture ideal for game UI
  - TypeScript adds type safety reducing bugs in game logic
  - Vite offers fast development experience
  - Styled Components allows for clean, modular styling
- **Consequences**: Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with TypeScript, but benefits in maintainability and readability.

### Decision 2: State Management Approach
- **Context**: Need efficient state management for game state.
- **Decision**: Using React Context API with useReducer hook rather than Redux.
- **Rationale**:
  - Simpler to set up than Redux for a single-page game
  - Sufficient for the complexity level of Tetris
  - Reduces bundle size and dependencies
  - Follows modern React patterns
- **Consequences**: Less boilerplate than Redux, potentially less scalable for more complex games.

### Decision 3: Game Logic Architecture
- **Context**: Game logic can become complex and needs to be testable.
- **Decision**: Implementing game logic as pure functions separate from UI components.
- **Rationale**:
  - Pure functions are easier to test
  - Separation of concerns between UI and game mechanics
  - Allows for easier debugging of game mechanics
  - Potential for reuse in different UI implementations
- **Consequences**: Requires clear interfaces between game logic and UI components.

### Decision 4: Project Structure
- **Context**: Need organized structure to maintain clean code architecture.
- **Decision**: Component-based structure with separation of UI components, game logic, and state management.
- **Rationale**:
  - Logical separation of concerns
  - Follows React best practices
  - Makes code navigation easier
  - Supports parallel development
- **Consequences**: Requires discipline to maintain boundaries between layers.

### Decision 5: Testing Strategy
- **Context**: Need reliable testing approach within time constraints.
- **Decision**: Focus on unit tests for game logic, with selected component tests for critical UI elements.
- **Rationale**:
  - Game logic contains most critical functionality
  - Pure functions are easy to test thoroughly
  - Component tests ensure UI integrity
  - Balance between coverage and development time
- **Consequences**: Some integration aspects may not be fully tested, focusing on core functionality.
